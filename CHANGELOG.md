## 0.5.3
* New debug API `describeDevices()` (iOS only for now): snapshot of the SDK's raw device list — identifier, link state, compatibility — plus the selector's current pick. Distinguishes "no devices discovered" (registration/Bluetooth/manifest) from "device filtered out" (e.g. `deviceUpdateRequired`) when `activeDeviceStream()` stays empty.
* iOS: Fix first-registration device discovery. The plugin's shared `AutoDeviceSelector` is created at registrar time — before the app is registered — and such an instance can stay permanently blind to devices that only surface after registration (`activeDeviceStream()` never reports a device, and `startStreamSession` fails `noEligibleDevice` forever). `restartActiveDeviceMonitoring()` now rebuilds the selector when it reports no active device (and no session is live) and force-restarts the monitoring loops onto the new instance — mirroring Meta's CameraAccess sample, which only creates its selector post-registration. Rebuilds are debounced (3s) so the back-to-back `restartActiveDeviceMonitoring()` calls a fresh registration triggers don't discard a still-discovering selector and prolong the no-device window.
* iOS: Fix a permanent hang in `startStreamSession` after a failed start. If a previous attempt threw (e.g. `noEligibleDevice` while the glasses were still linking up post-registration), the device session was left `.idle` and every subsequent call awaited a state transition that nothing would ever trigger — the Dart future never completed. The session is now re-`start()`ed from `.idle` (the SDK's documented retry path), and the wait for `.started` is bounded by a 20s timeout so a session the SDK wedges in any other non-terminal state (`.starting`/`.paused`/`.stopping`) surfaces an error instead of hanging the Dart future forever.
* iOS: When the device session stops before reaching `.started`, `startStreamSession` now surfaces the genuine error observed on the session's `errorStream()` instead of a fabricated `noEligibleDevice`.
* iOS: `restartActiveDeviceMonitoring()` also relaunches the plugin's internal device-availability watchdog (it previously only restarted the Dart-facing event loops, leaving the auto-teardown watcher dead after the SDK terminated its stream on unregistration).
* Docs: corrected `restartActiveDeviceMonitoring` — it has not been a no-op on iOS since 0.5.2; documented what it restarts per platform.

## 0.5.2
* iOS: Add Swift Package Manager support alongside CocoaPods.

## 0.5.1
* Prepare Android Gradle for Flutter's Built-in Kotlin migration.
* Camera permission errors are now typed `CameraPermissionException`s on both platforms; a `false` return means *user denied*, exclusively.
* Gate event-stream `debugPrint` behind `kDebugMode` so release builds stop logging plugin events.

## 0.5.0
* Update to DAT SDK 0.7.0 on iOS and Android. Existing Dart APIs unchanged; new opt-in additions below — non-breaking, drop-in upgrade.
* New `openDATGlassesAppUpdate()` — opens the Meta AI app to update the on-device DAT app. Pair with the new `datAppOnTheGlassesUpdateRequired` error code to drive a "tap to update" UI.
* New `deviceStateStream()` returning `Stream<DeviceState>` for live `ThermalLevel` updates. Lets apps warn the user *before* a thermal error stops the stream.
* New `StreamSessionError` codes: `thermalEmergency`, `peakPowerShutdown`, `batteryCritical`, plus device-session variants (`deviceThermalCritical`, `deviceThermalEmergency`, `devicePeakPowerShutdown`, `deviceBatteryCritical`, `datAppOnTheGlassesUpdateRequired`, `dwaUnavailable`).
* Inherits DAT 0.7.0 bug fixes: Android `checkPermission` double-resume crash, post-Bluetooth-reconnect stale state, photo capture timeout, `ServiceConnection` leak during registration; iOS session stop propagation.
* Display capability (new in DAT 0.7.0 for Ray-Ban Display glasses) is intentionally **not** bundled — to keep this package focused on camera. A future `flutter_meta_wearables_dat_display` add-on will mirror the mock-device split.

## 0.4.0
* **BREAKING**: MockDeviceKit moved to a separate optional package, `flutter_meta_wearables_dat_mock_device`. Production apps no longer link `MWDATMockDevice.xcframework` (iOS) or `mwdat-mockdevice` (Android) and therefore no longer need `NSCameraUsageDescription` (iOS) or the `CAMERA` permission (Android) just to ship the plugin. The Apple App Store binary scanner previously rejected v0.3.x builds that omitted those strings because MockDeviceKit unconditionally linked `AVFoundation`; that requirement is gone.
* Apps that pair against a mock device for development should add `flutter_meta_wearables_dat_mock_device` to `pubspec.yaml` and migrate calls — see the migration table below. The shape mirrors Firebase's `firebase_core` + per-feature packages and Datadog's `datadog_flutter_plugin` + `datadog_session_replay`.
* Mock APIs renamed (the `Mock*` prefix is now redundant given the namespace):

| Before (0.3.x, core) | After (0.4.0, mock add-on) |
|---|---|
| `MetaWearablesDat.configureMockDevices(...)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.configure(...)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.disableMockDevices()` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.disable()` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.pairMockRayBanMeta()` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.pairRayBanMeta()` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.unpairMockRayBanMeta(uuid)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.unpairRayBanMeta(uuid)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.setMockPermission(p, s)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.setPermission(p, s)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.setMockPermissionRequestResult(p, s)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.setPermissionRequestResult(p, s)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.mockDevicePowerOn(uuid)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.powerOn(uuid)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.mockDevicePowerOff(uuid)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.powerOff(uuid)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.mockDeviceDon(uuid)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.don(uuid)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.mockDeviceDoff(uuid)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.doff(uuid)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.setMockCameraFeed(uuid, path)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.setCameraFeed(uuid, path)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.setMockCameraFacing(uuid, f)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.setCameraFacing(uuid, f)` |
| `MetaWearablesDat.setMockCapturedImage(uuid, path)` | `MetaWearablesDatMockDevice.setCapturedImage(uuid, path)` |

* The `Permission`, `PermissionStatus`, and `CameraFacing` enums (referenced exclusively by mock APIs) moved to the mock add-on. Import them from `flutter_meta_wearables_dat_mock_device` after migrating.
* All non-mock APIs (`startRegistration`, `requestCameraPermission`, `requestAndroidPermissions`, `startStreamSession` / `stopStreamSession`, `capturePhoto`, `enableBackgroundStreaming` / `disableBackgroundStreaming`, every event stream) keep the same signatures and behavior — production code that doesn't touch mock devices needs no changes other than potentially removing `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `CAMERA`.

## 0.3.1
* Fix: CMSampleBufferGetFormatDescription used with .hvc1 background streaming to correctly pass VPS/SPS/PPS and enable ffmpeg_kit_flutter use cases while backgrounded.

## 0.3.0
* **BREAKING**: Update to DAT SDK 0.6.0 on iOS and Android.
* New `setMockCameraFacing()` to switch the mock device's camera between front and back; adds `CameraFacing`.
* New `configureMockDevices()`, `disableMockDevices()`, `setMockPermission()` and `setMockPermissionRequestResult()` for finer-grained mock device control.
* New `videoStreamSizeStream()` exposing the native video frame dimensions so Dart can drive an `AspectRatio` around the `Texture` widget instead of forcing a fixed size.
* New opt-in background streaming on **both iOS and Android**: `enableBackgroundStreaming(androidNotification:)` / `disableBackgroundStreaming()` keep the session alive when the host app is backgrounded or the phone is locked. iOS activates an `AVAudioSession` (`.playAndRecord` / `.videoRecording` with `.allowBluetoothHFP` + `.mixWithOthers`) and forces software HEVC decoding so the decoder survives background→foreground without stutter. Android starts a foreground service of type `connectedDevice` with a user-customizable notification (title/text/channelId/channelName/icon) and a `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK`; the plugin manifest auto-merges the required `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE`, and `WAKE_LOCK` permissions. iOS hosts must add `audio` and `bluetooth-central` to `UIBackgroundModes`.
* New `videoFramesStream()` emitting per-frame `VideoFrame` payloads (codec / bytes / width / height / presentationTimestampUs / isKeyframe) in **both foreground and background**, so apps can record to disk or run custom processing while the Flutter `Texture` can't render. Zero per-frame cost when no subscriber is attached. iOS emits BGRA for `raw` and raw `hvc1` NAL units for `hvc1`; Android emits I420 planar YUV (`width * height * 3/2` bytes) verbatim from the SDK.
* New `BackgroundNotification` value type for configuring the Android foreground service notification.

## 0.2.2
* **iOS**: `VideoCodec.hvc1` — invalidate `VTDecompressionSession` in background and recreate on foreground; stream session stays alive.

## 0.2.1
* Add AI coding agent configs (`AGENTS.md`, Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) with `install-skills.sh` installer.

## 0.2.0
* **BREAKING**: Update to DAT SDK 0.5.0 on iOS and Android.
* `startStreamSession()` gains `videoCodec` and new `VideoCodec`: `raw` (default, foreground-only) or `hvc1` (compressed HEVC, background-friendly, iOS only).
* New `streamSessionStateStream()` and `streamSessionErrorStream()` to observe session lifecycle (stopped, streaming, paused, …) and errors such as thermal limits; adds `StreamSessionState` and `StreamSessionError`.
* `capturePhoto()` gains `format` and new `PhotoCaptureFormat`: `heic` or `jpeg` (default `jpeg`).
* **Android**: Photo capture failures use typed `CaptureError` (e.g. DeviceDisconnected, NotStreaming, CaptureInProgress, CaptureFailed).
* High-resolution streaming at 720×1280 works reliably on both platforms.

## 0.1.2
* Add `captureStreamFrame` method.

## 0.1.1
* Add performance optimizations.

## 0.1.0
* Implement Texture API for streaming optimization.
* Add `streamQuality` parameter.
* Improve documentation and example app.

## 0.0.3
* Fix demo gif in README.

## 0.0.2
* Improve pub.dev package page.

## 0.0.1
* Initial release.
